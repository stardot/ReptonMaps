Repton (Electron Version)
=========================

Repton levels appear to be maps of 32 row by 32 columns.

The level data was found by loading the REPTON2 file into memory in MODE 5
and visually inspecting the data. The assumption was that level data follows
the sprite data.

Level data seems to start at 0x2c00.

Setting the lowest 4 bits of the first byte in the first level to 0 results
in a blank cell; setting it to 1 results in a diamond.

Setting the highest 4 bits of the first byte to 0 produces something other
than a blank space.

Setting multiple bytes to 0 results in a group of blank cells followed by
a teleporter-style cell - the type of cell used for teleporters in Repton 2.

Each row of the level appears to be 20 bytes long. This may mean that each
cell is stored in 5 bits.


After some experimentation and reading of levels, this is the mapping between
values and cell types:

     0: space
     1: diamond
     2: boulder
     3: egg
     4: key
     5: earth
     6: earth
     7: earth
     8: safe
     9: brick wall
    10: double (top/bottom) wall
    11: double (left/right) wall
    12: quadruple wall
    13: fancy wall
    14: smooth wall
    15: lower edged smooth wall
    16: upper edged smooth wall
    17: right edged smooth wall
    18: left edged smooth wall
    19: lower right curved smooth wall
    20: lower left curved smooth wall
    21: upper right curved smooth wall
    22: upper left curved smooth wall
    23: map
    24: lower edged brick wall
    25: upper edged brick wall
    26: right edged brick wall
    27: left edged brick wall
    28: lower right curved brick wall
    29: lower left curved brick wall
    30: upper right curved brick wall
    31: upper left curved brick wall

Sprites are stored at 0x2500 in the REPTON2 file and are 8 by 16 pixels. See
the table in the sprites module of the Repton package for the offsets into the
sprite data.

Repton (BBC Micro Version)
==========================

Cassette: The last part of the REPTON2 file, from 0x5300 to 0x55ff, is the
same as in the Electron version, from 0x4700 to 0x49ff.

DFS disk: The D.REPTON2 file contains the level data from 0x3800 onwards.


Repton2 (Electron Version)
==========================

Repton 2 levels appear to start at 0x2e00 and encode the data in rows of 20
bytes (5 bits per cell again).

Because the top row of Screen A is a single wall with two openings at the ends,
it is clear to see that values of 0x1f (31) are solid wall pieces and that
blank cells are 0x00 (0).

The top of Screen B appears to start at 0x2fe0. Screen A is only 24 rows high.
Many other screens are 32 rows high.

Screen C is 24 rows high.


Sprites appear to start at 0x2340.

Spirits are 4 by 8 pixels.
Other sprites are 12 by 24 pixels.

Text characters start at 0x2040.
Code appears to end at 0x1aff.

Level data
==========

Writing zero bytes into the file from 0x2001 to 0x203f results in a corrupted
Screen A and a topmost transporter that sends Repton to the leftmost skull
chamber with the palette for the level that should have been entered. This
means that the palette data is probably stored separately.

The first two bytes (0x2000, 0x2001) seem to control the displacement of the
Screen A data. The following bytes seem to control transporter destinations.

Byte 0x2028 appears to control the destination of the topmost transporter.
Byte 0x202c appears to control the transporter one square down and to the left
of it.
Byte 0x2004 appears to control the transporter to Screen B (below the first
boulder trap on the right of Screen A).

Bytes 0x2004 and 0x2005 control different aspects of the transportation. It
seems like the first byte controls what is copied into the top eight rows of
the level buffer, and the second byte controls some of the rows beneath.

It appears that each set of four bytes, from 0x2000 to 0x203f, contain four
indices into the level data which each refer to eight rows of level data.
The special index, 0x80, is the empty space at the bottom of Screen A.

By inspecting the 64 bytes of level data and comparing them to the maps on the
Stairway to Hell site, values of 0x80 and above appear to be placeholders for
eight rows that contain a single type of tile. So, 0x80 is eight rows of empty
space, 0x86 must be diamonds (as used in Screen P), and 0x83 has been tested to
be earth.

Transporters and puzzle pieces
==============================

Blanking the bytes from 0x1e50 to 0x1e8f results in a missing transporter in
the cluster under the key on Screen A.

Blanking the bytes from 0x1e00 to 0x1e3f results in missing puzzle pieces above
the skulls on Screen A.

Blanking the bytes from 0x1da0 to 0x1ddf results in a missing puzzle piece at
the top-left of Screen B. The first three bytes (01 02 06) appear to reference
the piece at x=2, y=6 where the first byte is the screen number (Screen B).

Each block of four bytes contains a screen number, x and y coordinates and
possibly a reference to the specific piece at that location. It appears that
the final number is the piece's location in the display area on Screen A.

At 0x1e50, the four bytes (00 00 08 0D) appear to represent screen number,
x and y coordinates and screen number for the transporter destination. The
following two bytes (1E 17) are the x and y coordinates of the transporter
destination.

The next entry appears at 0x1e56 (00 00 12 0B 11 18) which would indicate a
transporter at x=0, y=18 on Screen A with a destination on Screen L at x=17,
y=24. However, row 24 appears to be part of a placeholder block of eight
decorative wall rows, so the y coordinate appears to only take ordinary map
rows into account.

The end of the transporter definitions appears to be at 0x1fcf. There are zero
bytes from 0x1fd0 to 0x1fff.

Although transporters and transporter destinations are defined in the level
data, it seems that they are only there as placeholders to reserve space.

Puzzle piece sprites
--------------------

Since the puzzle piece locations are defined from 0x1da0 to 0x1e4f, there would
appear to be 44 of them. However, there are two incompletely defined entries
at 0x1e48 and 0x1e4c. In the area from 0x1c20 to 0x1d9f, there are lots of
similar bytes. Changing the first 9 to the same byte results in a redefined
puzzle piece shape for the first puzzle piece (on Screen B). The values in this
area refer to the puzzle piece sprites and are given as offsets from the start
of the sprite area (0x50 to 0x60).

Note that 42 * 9 = 378 and that the area from 0x1c20 and 0x1d9f accommodates
this number of bytes with six bytes to spare at the end.

Tile sprites
============

Since the puzzle pieces seem to be defined completely in the area described
then it is worth finding out where the other tile sprites are stored. Since
there are 32 of them, 32 * 9 = 288 (0x1c0), we can look for similar definitions
earlier in the file, possible from 0x1b00 to 0x1c1f.

This appears to work well, except that the transporter sprite is defined as
tile 11 and tile 2 is used to represent transporters in the level data.

Totals
======

The total number of earth tiles is stored in two bytes at 0x102f and 0x1034 as
part of a routine. The values are encoded as binary coded decimal with the
lowest first.

The total number of diamonds is stored in 0x1025 and 0x102a.
Total monsters is at 0x1020, transporters at 0x0164, puzzle pieces at 0x132.

The monsters, earth and diamonds totals are stored in locations from 0x0be0 to
0x0be4.

Looking at the code from 0x132 to 0x14b, it appears that the running total for
the puzzle pieces is stored at 0x0b81. Similarly, at 0x18b, the running total
for the transporters is stored at 0x0b80.

Start position
==============

This is stored at 0x1060 (x) and 0x1064 (y).

Skulls
======

The skulls at the top of Screen A disappear when certain totals reach zero and
Repton visits the status character. The first skull and its counterpart below
disappear when all monsters have been killed, the second when all diamonds are
collected, the third when all earth is collected, the fourth when all
transporters have been used, and the fifth when there is only one puzzle piece
left to collect.

The start of the file appears to contain code to check the values from 0x0be0
to 0x0be4 (the monsters, earth and diamonds totals). The code at 0x132 which
includes the puzzle piece total, appears to read the table at 0x1da0 (0x29a0).

Later, at 0x19c, the totals are checked and a value of 2 written to the
addresses, 0x421, 0x4a1, 0x423, 0x4a3, 0x424 and 0x4a5.

The puzzle piece and transporter totals are checked at 0x1cd and 0x1dc, and
a value of 2 written to 0x429, 0x4a9, 0x427 and 0x4a7 as a result.

This may mean that the working level, or persistent Screen A, is stored at
0x420 or thereabouts.

Palette
=======

At 0x394, there is the start of a VDU 19 sequence. This appears to split bytes
obtained from zero page into the two logical and physical colour values, with
the top four bits as the logical value and the lower four as the physical value.

The subroutine appears to start at 0x392:

    sta $00         ; 85 00
    lda #$13        ; A9 13
    jsr $ffee       ; 20 EE FF      ; VDU 19,
    lda $00         ; A5 00
    lsr lsr lsr lsr ; 4A 4A 4A 4A
    jsr $ffee       ; 20 EE FF      ; l,
    lda $00         ; A5 00
    and $0f         ; 29 0F
    jsr $ffee       ; 20 EE FF      ; p,
    lda #0          ; A9 00
    jsr $ffee       ; 20 EE FF      ; 0,
    jsr $ffee       ; 20 EE FF      ; 0
    jmp $ffee       ; 4C EE FF      ; 0 (and return via VDU)

The routine is located in the Electron's memory at 0xc00 + 0x392 = 0xf92. This
is called from 0x100e (0x1c0e) and 0x1074 (0x1c74).

The call at 0x100e sets the third colour to green (2) when the game loads.
The call at 0x1074 sets it when the game starts.

There are calls at 0x2888 and 0x2894, which appear to set two colours using the
routine at 0x392 (0xf92). The routine starting at 0x2888 (0x3488) is called
from 0x107f. The code leading up to this is mentioned above (setting colour 3)
and is followed by

    lda $8b         ; A5 8B
    and #$03        ; 29 03
    tax             ; AA
    lda $0f43,x     ; BD 43 0F  ; loads the value from 0x343 (0xf43)
    jsr $3488       ; 20 88 34  ; jumps to the routine at 0x2888 (0x3488)

The routine at 0x2888 is:

    jsr $0f92       ; 20 92 0F
    ldx $a6         ; A6 8B
    cpx #$02        ; E0 02
    bcs #$06        ; B0 06     -> rts
    lda $35c0,x     ; BD C0 35  ; 0x29c0 (0x35c0)
    jsr $0f92       ; 20 92 0F
    rts             ; 60

At 0x29c0, there are some two values which are followed by a routine starting
at 0x29c2. These two values appear to control the colours of the first two
screens.

Repton 2 (BBC Micro DFS Version)
================================

Loading the D.REPB file into screen memory, it seems that the sprites finish at
offset 0x3500. Seeing a span of values similar to those at 0x2e00 in the
Electron version, and using EOR to compare what seem to be equivalent values,
it appears that each byte in the file is encoded with EOR 0x66.

We look for equivalent spans of values to those in the above table in order to
identify the equivalent areas in the file.

0x1b00-0x1b3f       Screen area definitions
0x1b40-0x1cbf       Transporter definitions
0x1cf8-0x1d9f       Puzzle piece locations

0x3500-0x52ff       Level definitions
